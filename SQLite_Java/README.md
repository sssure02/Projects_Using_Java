# Connecting SQLite Database with Java

#### In this project, I connected a SQLite database to my java program through SQLite JDBC driver. The SQLite database named music_artists was provided for the project. 

#### Basically, I had to extract the information from the tables in the database to create objects and print the information of the objects onto the console. The output.pdf file shows the printed information.
