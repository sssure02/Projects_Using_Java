# Secure Message System

#### Through this project, I developed a program to securely send messages between a group of people. You can look at the output.pdf file to see how the user is interacting with the program. The SecurityDemo.java file is used to implement the program and uses the SecuritySystem class to perform the actions specified by the user. To send or read message, message objects are created using the SecureMessage class.
