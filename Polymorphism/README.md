# Polymorphism

#### In this project, we had to demonstrate our understanding of polymorphism, an important aspect of object oriented programming (OOPS). Polymorphism allows instructions, generally a method, to do different things based on the context (object).

#### Here, an abstract class named Enemy was created, which includes a abstract method called attack which prints out the noise the enemy makes. This class was inherited by multiple child classes. Each of the child class is a different type of enemy and has its own implementation of the attack method. The different types of enemies are dragon, ghost, goblin, and ogre. 

#### In EnemyDemo.java file, we implement polymorphism. When objects of the child classes are created and their attack method is called, the method prints out different strings based on the object during runtime and we can see these differences in the output.pdf file.
