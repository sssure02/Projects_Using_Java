# Classes and Objects

#### A class is a blueprint and an object is an instance of a class. In this project, we had to create a class named Employee which implements the java.lang.Comparable interface. So, we can compare objects of this class with each other. 

#### In the EmployeeDemo.java file, we create multiple instances (objects) of the Employee class. Using these objects, we call their methods and compare them with each other.
