# Image Search

#### In this project, we will use the image_info.txt file, which lists the names of multiple png (image) files and the categories the image fits in [the categories are listed next to the file's name].

#### The java program uses this txt file and asks the user a category they are interested in. Then, it would print out a list of images that fit in the given category. The program would end when specified, show no results if there are no images in the given category, and list images that would fit in either 2 or both categories.
